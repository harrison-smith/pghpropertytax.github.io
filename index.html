			The majority of U.S. municipalities chronically overtax non-white homeowners and low-value homes. We analyzed Allegheny County assessment and real estate data from 2012-2021 to reveal that during these years, the county assessed Pittsburgh’s lowest value homes at twice their same-year market value, while the highest value homes were assessed at just over half their market value. We also found that Pittsburgh’s black homes were assessed at 7.5% more, on average, than comparable white homes.

			Most counties perform assessments regularly to keep assessment values up to date, but this is not required in Pennsylvania. Allegheny county’s most recent reassessment took place in 2012, and assessment values have been held constant since then despite local market fluctuations.

			Using property level data about <span style="font-style:italic">assessment value, sale price,</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">demographic information</span> for representative properties in the city of Pittsburgh, we are able to examine racial disparity in property tax assessment at a granular level.
		</p>

		<p id="description">
			Overall, our study indicates that properties in Pittsburgh are taxed at an average of <span style="font-style:italic">72.5%</span>  of their fair market values. 
		</p>

		<h4>Fig. 1.2: Mean Assessment Ratio by Property Value</h4>
		<div id="chartcontainer" viewBox="0 0 960 500" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet">
			<div id="chart1"></div>
		</div>
		<br>

		<p id="description">
			However, this rate is not consistent across income, race, or property value. In fact, it is sharply regressive on all of these dimensions.
		</p>
		<br>

		<div class="pair">
			<div class="term">The lowest-valued 10%</span></div> 
			<div class="def">of homes in Pittsburgh are taxed at a rate nearly <span style="font-style:italic">3 times</span>  that of the highest-valued 10%.</div>  
		</div>
		<br>

		<h4>Fig. 1.3: Mean Assessment Ratio by Income Decile</h4>
		<div id="chart2"></div>
		<br>

		<p id="description">
			A similar trend is evident in the relationship of income to assessment ratio, where the lowest-earning homeowners are taxed at an average rate <span style="font-style:italic">1.28x higher</span> than the highest-earning homeowners.
		</p>

		<p id="description">
			This property value and income data is tied to racial bias. Black homeowners represent a disproportionate number of the lowest-valued properties and the lowest-earning households. The heavy clustering of low-value property in Black neighborhoods combined with the over-assessment of that property results in racially biased tax regressivity. 
		</p>
		<br>
		<br>

		<div class="pair">
			<div class="term">Black Homeowners</span></div> 
			<div class="def">pay on average <span style="font-style:italic">7.5% more</span> in property taxes than white owners of similar-valued homes typically do. </div>
		</div>  
		<br>

		<h4>Fig. 1.4: Distribution of Property Value by Race</h4>
		<div id="chart3"></div>

		<h4>Fig. 1.5: Distribution of Assessment Ratio by Race</h4>
		<div id="chart4"></div>
		<br>

		<p id="description">
			These distributions show that property values, and to a lesser extent assessment ratios, coincide with racial boundaries. Because Black Homeowners tend to have properties of lower value, and lower-value properties tend to be over-assessed, Black Homeowners are more likely to be over-taxed.  
		<br>
		<br>

		<p id="description">
			Controlling for census tract eliminates this statistically significant racial gap, indicating that racial bias in property assessment operates through location. In other words, while Black homes are not individually over-assessed, Black neighborhoods are.

		<div class="pair">
			<div class="term">Regressive Taxation</span></div> 
			<div class="def">refers to tax policies that place more of a burden on lower-income taxpayers. </div>  
		</div>
		<br>

		<p id="description">
			Regressive property taxation is one element of a long history of redlining and discriminatory urban policy that has created dense clusters of low-value housing. This financial structure contributes to the consolidation of low-income homeowners in specific areas, and works to prevent them from dispersing outside of those areas.

		<p id="description">
			Our call to action is for the County Assessor’s office to recalibrate the assessment process in order to mitigate the regressivity of its current property taxation model. Our results show that accounting for local differences could almost entirely eliminate the racial and class-based disparities in the tax burden, and we encourage reforms in response to this conclusion.
